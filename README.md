# Skin_microbiome
This project analyzes skin microbiome composition and diversity using amplicon sequencing data. The analysis was performed in R using Google Colab, with datasets accessed from a cloud bucket ( AWS S3). The goal is to explore microbial community structure, diversity metrics, and taxonomic abundance.
